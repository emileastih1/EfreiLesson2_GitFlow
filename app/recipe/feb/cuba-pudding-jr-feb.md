My husband used to not like pancakes and absolutely hate pancake syrup until I had him try the oatmeal pancake with mango or blueberry sauce. Now he regularly asks me to make some for breakfast. Serve warm with your favorite syrup or sauce.

Ingredients
1 cup milk

⅔ cup quick-cooking oats

⅔ cup all-purpose flour

2 tablespoons brown sugar

1 ½ teaspoons baking powder

½ teaspoon salt

¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon

2 eggs

2 teaspoons butter, melted

½ teaspoon vanilla extract

¼ cup milk, or more as needed

2 teaspoons butter, or as needed

Directions
Place 1 cup milk in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until bubbling, about 2 minutes. Stir in the oats.

Mix flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Whisk eggs, 2 teaspoons melted butter, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; add 1/4 cup milk. Mix oat mixture and egg mixture with flour mixture; stir to combine.

Heat 2 teaspoons butter on a griddle or skillet over medium heat; pour about 1/3 cup batter into the hot butter. Cook pancakes until bubbles appear on top layer, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook other side until evenly browned, about 5 more minutes.

I used TWO maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal packets in this recipe as I seem to be out of plain instant oats in my pantry right now. I also used lowfat buttermilk. I've made pancakes with oatmeal before so I knew to let the batter sit 10-15 minutes as the oats need to soak up some of the liquid. This way you know to gauge if the batter needs more liquid. Mine did NOT. The pancakes puffed up nicely and turned out light and fluffy. My husband and kids ate up every single one of these pancakes......my husband especially surprized me by telling me how much he liked this recipe.

These pancakes are really terrible. I usually love any kind of oatmeal pancakes, but I thought these were a waste of time and ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out a gross chewy texture. They also tasted an awful lot like baking powder. I would not recommend this recipe!!!!

Great recipe. Excellent starting point for an oatmeal pancake. Fruit and other variations work well, but always keeping the base recipe complete.

Made this with gluten free flour and almond milk, it was amazing! Hard to find recipes that work with gluten free ingredients, will definitely make again!

We’ve made these about 1000 times... they’re SO good! Sometimes we throw in some chopped up, peeled apple and a bit of cinnamon

I put everything in a bowl, used old fashioned oats, and while they were cooking I read the instructions....They were great; so if you don’t feel like microwaving and just using one bowl, that works too!

My kids really liked these so I should make a double batch because this made 8 pancakes-not enough for all 5 of us unless you are serving something alongside them. I did cut back on brown sugar-didn’t pack it at all and probably used 1 1/4 T - 1 1/2 T. These would be yummy with pecans in them.
