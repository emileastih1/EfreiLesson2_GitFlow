## Ingredients

- ¼ cup apple cider vinegar, divided
- ¼ cup olive oil, divided
- 1 ¼ teaspoons kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 2 pounds fingerling potatoes halved lengthwise
- ½ cup fresh curly parsley leaves
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
- Flaky sea salt, for serving

# Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 F. Whisk 3 tablespoons each of vinegar and oil in a large bowl until well combined. Season with kosher salt and several grinds of pepper. Add potatoes and toss to coat.
2. Arrange potatoes, cut sides down, in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until golden on the bottoms and tender when pierced with a fork, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes.
3. Toss potatoes with the remaining 1 tablespoon each vinegar and oil on a baking sheet. Fold in parsley, oregano, and dill just before serving. Top with flaky sea salt. The finished dish can stand at room temperature for up to 1 hour.
