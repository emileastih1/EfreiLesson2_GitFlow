# Salt-and-Vinegar Roasted Potatoes

May we propose a new maxim for cooking: If it tastes great in chip form, then it follows that it will taste great on roasted potatoes. Case in point, this simple recipe, which takes its flavor cues from the eponymous chips. You'll roast the potatoes in a bath of apple cider vinegar, olive oil, and salt, natch. After roasting until crispy perfection, you'll finish them off with a shower of fresh herbs, plus more vinegar and flaky sea salt to amp up that salt-and-vinegar vibe.
