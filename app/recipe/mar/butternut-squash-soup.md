## Ingredients

2 tbsp Butter
1 small onion, chopped
1 stalk celery, chopped
1 medium carrot, chopped
2 medium potatoes, cubed
1 medium Butternut squash, peeled, seeded and cubed
32oz Chicken Stock
- Salt and pepper to taste
 

# Instructions

1. Prepare the Butternut Squash
	1a. Cut the squash in half crosswise, separating the "bulb" from the "tube." Slice the stem and the bottom of the bulb off and stand both pieces on a flat surface.

	1b. Use a vegetable peeler to peel away the skin from top to bottom. Once both are peeled, cut each piece in half, scoop out the seeds, and chop.

2. Gather all ingredients.

3. Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat, and cook onion, celery, carrot, potatoes, and squash until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Pour in enough chicken stock to cover vegetables. 
4. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover pot, and simmer until all vegetables are tender, about 40 minutes.
5. Transfer soup to a blender and process until smooth. Return to the pot and mix in any remaining stock to reach desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper.
6. Serve hot and enjoy!
