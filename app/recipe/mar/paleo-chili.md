# Paleo Chili

Paleo (eating like our pre-agricultural revolution ancestors ate) chili is made without beans. 
In the west we typically include beans, but I think even non-paleo eaters will enjoy this deep smoky flavorful chili. 
This is best made a day ahead so the flavors can meld together. Serve with green onions and sour cream.

## Ingredients

- 1 dried chipotle pepper, stem removed

- 1 cup boiling water

- 1 ½ teaspoons coconut oil

- 1 cup chopped yellow onion

- 1 cup chopped green bell pepper

- 1 cup chopped red bell pepper

- 4 garlic cloves, minced

- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

- 1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes

# Instructions

1. Soak chipotle pepper in boiling water until softened, about 10 minutes. Remove pepper from water and mince.
2. Melt coconut oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, green bell pepper, and red bell pepper until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir garlic and minced chipotle into onion mixture and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
3. Stir bison and sausage into onion mixture. Cook and stir until meat is browned and crumbly, 10 to 12 minutes.
